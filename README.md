##Installation

Find your Packages folder and run the following command

    git clone git@github.com:AlexanderEkdahl/github-sublime-theme.git

To enable the theme goto Preferences > github-sublime-theme > GitHub

If you want even more GitHub likeness you can add the following to your user settings

    "font_size": 12.2,
    "font_face": "Courier",
    "font_options": ["subpixel_antialias"]
    "line_padding_bottom": 1,
    "line_padding_top": 1,

##Update

Go to the folder where you cloned the repo(Default is Packages/github-sublime-theme)

    git pull origin master

##Contributing

I know it is not perfect(nor is the one used on GitHub) but any fixes are welcome. Ruby, Haskell and HTML highlighting are almost identical to the GitHub highlighting.
